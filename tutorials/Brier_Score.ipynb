    "\n",
    "Probabilistic forecasts of binary events are expressed as values between 0 and 1, and observations are exactly 0 (event did not occur), or 1 (event occured).\n",

    "The metric is then calculated the same way as MSE. The Brier score is a [strictly proper scoring rule](https://sites.stat.washington.edu/people/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf) where lower values are better (it is negatively oriented) where a perfect score is 0 and the worst score is 1.\n"
