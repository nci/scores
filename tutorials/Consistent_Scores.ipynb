    "# Consistent scores\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"consistent scoring function\" is a scoring function where following a forecast directive will optimise the forecaster's expected score. It is important to use consistent scoring functions to avoid the \"forecaster's dilemma\" ([Lerch et al., 2017](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/Forecasters-Dilemma-Extreme-Events-and-Forecast-Evaluation/10.1214/16-STS588.full)) (i.e., should a forecaster issue an honest forecast or should they issue one that optimises their expected score?).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE is a consistent score for forecasting the mean and the MAE is a consistent score for forecasting the median. But did you know that there are a whole family of scores that are consistent for prediciting the mean, median, or a quantile? \n",
    "\n",
    "Score's consistent scoring module provides access to these families of consistent scores that can we used to emphasise predictive performance across desired decision thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1. A score consistent with the mean\n",
    "Let's jump into an example that illustrates a scoring function that is consistent with predicting the mean value using scores. **-Add interpretation here**\n",
    "\n",
    "Medians relate to quantiles in an analogous way to how the mean relates to [expectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our consistent scoring function for expectiles is \n",
    "\n",
    " $$ S(x, y) =\n",
    "    \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    (1 - \\alpha)(\\phi(y) - \\phi(x) - \\phi'(x)(y-x)), & y < x \\\\\n",
    "    \\alpha(\\phi(y) - \\phi(x) - \\phi'(x)(y-x)), & x \\leq y\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- $x$ is the forecast\n",
    "- $y$ is the observation\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the expectile level\n",
    "- $\\phi$ is a [convex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function) of a single variable\n",
    "- $\\phi'$ is the [subderivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative) of $\\phi$. The subderivative is a generalisation of the derivative for convex functions and coincides with the derivative when the convex function is differentiable\n",
    "- $S(x,y)$ is the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the expectile the consistent with the mean, set $\\alpha=0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example let's set $\\phi(z) = e^z$. This means that when we take the subderivative of $\\phi(z)$, we also have $\\phi'(z) = e^z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our scoring function then is \n",
    "$$ S(x, y) = 0.5(e^y - e^x - e^x(y-x))$$\n"
