    "**If the data is already binary, ignore this step and go straight to step two.**\n",

    "However, in many situations, data is not binary and is instead either continuous or categorical. An example of continuous data is a physical quantity, such as a temperature in degrees Celcius. An example of categorical data is the [Beaufort Wind Scale](https://www.rmets.org/metmatters/beaufort-wind-scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use binary contingency scores, any non-binary data must first be converted into binary data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Options include either:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- convert the non-binary data into binary data outside of `scores`, then input the binary data into `scores` (in which case, go to step two), OR  \n",
    "- use `scores` to efficiently convert the non-binary data into binary data, using the `scores` \"event operator\" class. \n",
    "\n",
    "`scores` provides a general class called an \"EventOperator\". `scores` provides in-built event operator types (e.g. greater-than, less-than and many others). Alternatively, users can define their own event operator implementation for use within `scores` (for example, for more complex event definitions involving multiple variables).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The rest of this section focuses on using `scores` to convert continuous data into binary data using the \"event operator\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's say you need to verify how accurately a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system forecasts \"heavy rainfall\". As the NWP preciptation rate predictions are continuous, you will need to first convert the precitation rate predictions into \"heavy rainfall events\" as binary data. To do this, you:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- first define an \"event operator\" - in this case by defining what constitutes a \"heavy rainfall event\", for example precitation above a specified threshold, and  \n",
    "- then apply this \"heavy rainfall event\" operator to the continuous precipiation rate prediction data. Doing so will convert the predictions into binary data - into either \"heavy rainfall event = true\" or \"heavy rainfall event = false\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex event like \"a thunderstorm\" may involve more complex logic to determine when the event occurs, incorporating factors such as wind and lightning data as well as the rainfall rate. \n",

The tranformed table contains only the resultant contingency table, which is thereafter very fast to work with.\n",
