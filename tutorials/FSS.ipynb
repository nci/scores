    "## FSS for a single 2D field\n",
    "FSS is computed over 2D arrays representing the observations & forecasts in the spatial domain. The user has to make sure that the input dimensions correspond to the spatial domain e.g. `lat x lon`. Generally the computation involves sliding a window over the input field(s) and applying a threshold over the fcst and obs values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting binary field is summed up to represent the populace (number of ones/\"true\" values in the window).\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting 2-D field of rolling sums represents \"_Integral Image_\" of the respective forecast and obeservation fields, which is then aggregated over all the sliding windows to compute the fractions skill score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FSS is then roughly defined as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    fss = 1 - sum_w((p_o - p_f)^2) / (sum_w(p_o^2) + sum_w(p_f^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "    where,\n",
    "    p_o: observation populace > threshold, in one window\n",
    "    p_f: forecast populace > threshold, in one window\n",
    "    sum_w: sum over all windows\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation details are beyond the scope of this tutorial please refer to, [Fast calculation of the Fractions Skill Score][fss_ref] for more info\n",

    "- forecast 2-D field (in spatial domain)\n",
    "- observations 2-D field (in spatial domain)\n",

    "As apparent above, with the same distribution, we get a score close to 1, this is because the FSS doesn't actually care about where in any given windows the binary fields match; only the total count. With a biased distribution the score dips a lot, which is expected with a threshold of 0.5 and a bias of 1.0. Whereas for a variant forecast, we still get a reasonable score, this is also expected since the variation isn't too large and the distributions still overlap quite a bit."
