# Summary

`scores` is a Python package containing mathematical functions for the verification, evaluation and optimisation of forecasts, predictions or models. It primarily supports the geoscience communities; in particular, the meteorological, climatological and oceanographic communities. In addition to supporting the Earth system science communities, it also has wide potential application in machine learning and other domains such as economics.

`scores` not only includes common scores (e.g. Mean Absolute Error), it also includes novel scores not commonly found elsewhere (e.g. FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score, Flip-Flop Index), complex scores (e.g. threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score), and statistical tests (such as the Diebold Mariano test). It also contains isotonic regression which is becoming an increasingly important tool in forecast verification and can be used to generate stable reliability diagrams. Additionally, it provides pre-processing tools for preparing data for scores in a variety of formats including cumulative distribution functions (CDF). At the time of writing, `scores` includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools.

All of the scores and statistical techniques in this package have undergone a thorough scientific and software review. Every score has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial that demonstrates its use in practice.

`scores` primarily supports `xarray` datatypes for Earth system data, allowing it to work with NetCDF4, HDF5, Zarr and GRIB data sources among others. `scores` uses Dask for scaling and performance. It has expanding support for `pandas`.  

The software repository can be found at [https://github.com/nci/scores/](https://github.com/nci/scores/).

# Statement of Need

The research purpose of this software is (a) to mathematically verify and validate scientific research and (b) to foster research into new scores and metrics. 

## Key Benefits of `scores`

In order to meet the needs of researchers, `scores` provides the following key benefits.

**Data Handling**

- Works with n-dimensional data (e.g., geospatial, vertical and temporal dimensions) for both point-based and gridded data. `scores` can effectively handle the dimensionality, data size and data structures commonly utilised for:
  - gridded Earth system data (e.g. numerical weather prediction models)
  - tabular, point, latitude/longitude or site-based data (e.g. forecasts for specific locations).
- Handles missing data, masking of data and weighting of results.
- Supports `xarray` [@Hoyer:2017] datatypes, and works with NetCDF4 [@NetCDF:2024], HDF5 [@HDF5:2020], Zarr [@zarr:2020] and GRIB [@GRIB:2024] data sources among others.

**Usability**

- A companion Jupyter Notebook [@Jupyter:2024] tutorial for each metric and statistical test that demonstrates its use in practice.
- Novel scores not commonly found elsewhere (e.g. FIRM [@Taggart:2022a], Flip-Flop Index [@Griffiths:2019; @griffiths2021circular]).
- All scores and statistical techniques have undergone a thorough scientific and software review.
- An area specifically to hold emerging scores which are still undergoing research and development. This provides a clear mechanism for people to share, access and collaborate on new scores, and be able to easily re-use versioned implementations of those scores.  

**Compatability**

- Highly modular and avoids extensive dependencies by providing its own implementations where relevant.
- Easy to integrate and use in a wide variety of environments. It has been tested and used on workstations, servers and in high performance computing (supercomputing) environments.
- Uses Dask [@Dask:2016] for scaling and performance.
- Expanding support for `pandas` [@pandas:2024; @McKinney:2010].

## Metrics, Statistical Techniques and Data Processing Tools Included in `scores` 

At the time of writing, `scores` includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. For an up to date list, please see the `scores` documentation.

We anticipate more metrics, tools and statistical techniques will be added over time.

## Use in Academic Work

In 2015, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began developing a new verification system called Jive. For a description of Jive see @loveday2024jive. The Jive verification metrics have been used to support several publications [@Griffiths:2017; @Foley:2020; @Taggart:2022d; @Taggart:2022b; @Taggart:2022c]. `scores` has arisen from the Jive verification system and was created to modularise the Jive verification functions and make them available as an open source package. 

`scores` has been used to explore user-focused approaches to evaluating probabilistic and categorical forecasts [@Loveday2024ts].

## Related Software Packages

There are multiple open source verification packages in a range of languages. Below is a comparison of `scores` to other open source Python verification packages. None of these include all of the functions implemented within `scores`, and vice versa.

`xskillscore` [@xskillscore] provides many of the same functions as `scores`. The Jupyter Notebook tutorials in `scores` cover a wider array of metrics. 

`climpred` [@Brady:2021] utilises `xskillscore` combined with data handling functionality, and is focused on ensemble forecasts for climate and weather. `climpred` makes some design choices related to data structure (specifically associated with climate modelling) which may not generalise effectively to broader use cases. Releasing `scores` separately allows the differing design philosophies to be considered by the community.

`METplus` [@Brown:2021] is widely used by weather and climate model developers. `METplus` includes a database and a visualisation system, with Python and shell script wrappers to utilise the complex `MET` package. Verification scores in `MET` are implemented in C++ rather than Python.

`Verif` [@nipen2023verif] is a command line tool for generating verification plots and is utilised very differently to `scores`. 

`Pysteps` [@gmd-12-4185-2019; @Imhoff:2023] is a package for short-term ensemble prediction systems, and includes a significant verification submodule with many useful verification scores. As `Pysteps` includes functionality well beyond verification, it is not as modular. 

`PyForecastTools` [@Morley:2020] is a Python package for model and forecast validation which supports `dmarray` rather than `xarray` data structures and does not include Jupyter Notebook tutorials.
