	abstract     = {The degree to which a forecast changes from one issue time to the next is an interesting aspect of a forecast system. Weather forecasters report that they are reluctant to change a forecast if they judge there is a risk of it being changed back again. They believe such instability detracts from the message being delivered and are reluctant to use automated guidance which they perceive as having lack of stability. A Flip-Flop Index was developed to quantify this characteristic of revisions of fixed-event forecasts. The index retains physically meaningful units, has a simple definition and does not penalize a sequence of forecasts that show a trend, which is important when assessing forecasts where a trend can be interpreted as a forecast becoming more confident with a shorter lead time. The Flip-Flop Index was used to compare the stability of sequences of automated guidance with the official Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecasts, which are prepared manually. The results show that the forecasts for chance of rain from the automated guidance are often more stable than the official, manual forecasts. However, the official forecasts for maximum temperature are more stable than those based on automated guidance. The Flip-Flop Index is independent of observations and does not measure skill, but it can play a complementary role in characterizing and evaluating a forecasting system.}

	abstract     = {In the practice of point prediction, it is desirable that forecasters receive a directive in the form of a statistical functional. For example, forecasters might be asked to report the mean or a quantile of their predictive distributions. When evaluating and comparing competing forecasts, it is then critical that the scoring function used for these purposes be consistent for the functional at hand, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. We show that any scoring function that is consistent for a quantile or an expectile functional can be represented as a mixture of elementary or extremal scoring functions that form a linearly parameterized family. Scoring functions for the mean value and probability forecasts of binary events constitute important examples. The extremal scoring functions admit appealing economic interpretations of quantiles and expectiles in the context of betting and investment problems. The Choquet-type mixture representations give rise to simple checks of whether a forecast dominates another in the sense that it is preferable under any consistent scoring function. In empirical settings it suffices to compare the average scores for only a finite number of extremal elements. Plots of the average scores with respect to the extremal scoring functions, which we call Murphy diagrams, permit detailed comparisons of the relative merits of competing forecasts.}

Here, a flexible family of scoring functions is presented for evaluating the performance of ordered multicategorical forecasts. Each score has a risk parameter α\$\$ \alpha \$\$, selected for the specific use case, so that it is consistent with a forecast directive based on the fixed threshold probability 1−α\$\$ 1-\alpha \$\$ (equivalently, a fixed α\$\$ \alpha \$\$-quantile mapping). Each score also has use-case specific weights so that forecasters who accurately discriminate between categorical thresholds are rewarded in proportion to the weight for that threshold. A variation is presented where the penalty assigned to near misses or close false alarms is discounted, which again is consistent with directives based on fixed risk measures. The scores presented provide an alternative to many performance measures currently in use, whose optimal threshold probabilities for forecasting an event typically vary with each forecast case, and in the case of equitable scores are based around sample base rates rather than risk measures suitable for users.}

The test assumes only isotropy and short-range spatial dependence of the loss differential but does allow it to be non-Gaussian, non-zero-mean, and spatially correlated. Constant and nonconstant spatial trends in the loss differential are treated in two separate cases. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the size and power properties of this test, and an example based on daily average wind speeds in Oklahoma is used for illustration.

	abstract = {Abstract Flash flood early warning requires accurate rainfall forecasts with a high spatial and temporal resolution. As the first few hours ahead are already not sufficiently well captured by the rainfall forecasts of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, radar rainfall nowcasting can provide an alternative. Because this observation-based method quickly loses skill after the first 2 hr of the forecast, it needs to be combined with NWP forecasts to extend the skillful lead time of short-term rainfall forecasts, which should increase decision-making times. We implemented an adaptive scale-dependent ensemble blending method in the open-source pysteps library, based on the Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System scheme. In this implementation, the extrapolation (ensemble) nowcast, (ensemble) NWP, and noise components are combined with skill-dependent weights that vary per spatial scale level. To constrain the (dis)appearance of rain in the ensemble members to regions around the rainy areas, we have developed a Lagrangian blended probability matching scheme and incremental masking strategy. We describe the implementation details and evaluate the method using three heavy and extreme (July 2021) rainfall events in four Belgian and Dutch catchments. We benchmark the results of the 48-member blended forecasts against the Belgian NWP forecast, a 48-member nowcast, and a simple 48-member linear blending approach. Both on the radar domain and catchment scale, the introduced blending approach predominantly performs similarly or better than only nowcasting (in terms of event-averaged continuous ranked probability score and critical success index values) and adds value compared with NWP for the first hours of the forecast, although the difference, particularly with the linear blending method, reduces when we focus on catchment-average cumulative rainfall sums instead of instantaneous rainfall rates. By properly combining observations and NWP forecasts, blending methods such as these are a crucial component of seamless prediction systems.},
