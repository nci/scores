## Version 1.0.0 (July 10, 2024)

We are happy to have reached the point of releasing “Version 1.0.0” of `scores`. While we look forward to many version increments to come, version 1.0.0 represents a milestone. It signifies a stabilisation of the API, and marks a turning point from the initial construction period. We have also published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06889) in the Journal of Open Source Software (see citation further below).

From this point forward, `scores` will be following the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) in its release management. 

This is a good moment to acknowledge and thank the contributors that helped us reach this point. They are: Tennessee Leeuwenburg, Nicholas Loveday, Elizabeth E. Ebert, Harrison Cook, Mohammadreza Khanarmuei, Robert J. Taggart, Nikeeth Ramanathan, Maree Carroll, Stephanie Chong, Aidan Griffiths and John Sharples.
