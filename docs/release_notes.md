# Release Notes (What's New)

## Version 2.0.0 (December 7, 2024)

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/1.3.0...2.0.0). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Breaking Changes

- The function `scores.probability.tw_crps_for_ensemble` previously took an optional (mis-spelled) argument `chainging_func_kwargs`. The spelling has been corrected and the argument is now `chaining_func_kwargs`. See [PR #780](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/780) and [PR #772](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/772).
- For those who develop on `scores`, you will need to update your installion of the `scores` package with `pip install -e .[all]`, to get updated versions of `black`, `pylint` and `mypy`. See [PR #768](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/768), [PR #769](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/769) and [PR #771](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/771).

### Features

- Added three new metrics:
	- Brier score for ensembles: `scores.probability.brier_score_for_ensemble`. See [PR #735](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/735).
	- Negative predictive value: `scores.categorical.BasicContingencyManager.negative_predictive_value`. See [PR #759](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/759).
	- Positive predictive value: `scores.categorical.BasicContingencyManager.positive_predictive_value`. See [PR #761](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/761) and [PR #756](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/756).
- Also added one new emerging metric and two supporting functions:
	- Risk matrix score: `scores.emerging.risk_matrix_scores`.
	- Risk matrix score - matrix weights to array: `scores.emerging.matrix_weights_to_array`.
	- Risk matrix score - warning scaling to weight array: `scores.emerging.weights_from_warning_scaling`.  
	See [PR #724](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/724) and [PR #794](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/794).  
- A new method called `format_table` was added to the class `BasicContingencyManager` to improve visualisation of 2x2 contingency tables. The tutorial `Binary_Contingency_Scores` was updated to demonstrate the use of this function. See [PR #775](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/775).
- The functions `scores.processing.comparative_discretise`, `scores.processing.binary_discretise` and `scores.processing.binary_discretise_proportion` now accept either a string indicating the choice of operator to be used, or an operator from the [Python core library `operator` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html). Using one of the operators from the Python core module is recommended, as doing so is more reliable for a variety of reasons. Support for the use of a string may be removed in future. See [PR #740](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/740) and [PR #758](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/758).

### Documentation

- Added "The Risk Matrix Score" tutorial. See [PR #724](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/724) and [PR #794](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/794). 
- Updated the "Brier Score" tutorial to include a new section about the Brier score for ensembles. See [PR #735](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/735).
- Updated the "Binary Categorical Scores and Binary Contingency Tables (Confusion Matrices)" 
  tutorial:
  - Included "positive predictive value" in the list of binary categorical scores.
  - Included "negative predictive value" in the list of binary categorical scores.
  - Demonstrated the use of the new `format_table` method for visualising 2x2 contingency tables.  
  See [PR #759](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/759) and [PR #775](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/775). 
- Updated the “Contributing Guide”:
	- Added a new section: "Creating Your Own Fork of `scores` for the First Time".
	- Updated the section: "Workflow for Submitting Pull Requests".
	- Added a new section: "Pull Request Etiquette".  
	See [PR #787](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/787).
- Updated the README:
	- Added a link to a video of a PyCon AU 2024 conference presentation about `scores`. See [PR #783](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/783).
	- Added a link to the archives of `scores` on Zenodo. See [PR #784](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/784).
- Added `Scoringrules` to "Related Works". See [PR #746](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/746), [PR #766](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/766) and [PR #789](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/789).

### Internal Changes

- Removed scikit-learn as a dependency. `scores` has replaced the use of scikit-learn with a similar function from SciPy (which was an existing `scores` dependency). This change was manually tested and found to be faster. See [PR #774](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/774).
- Version pinning of dependencies in release files (the wheel and sdist files used by PyPI and conda-forge) is now managed and set by the `hatch_build` script. This allows development versions to be free-floating, while being more specific about dependencies in releases. The previous process also aimed to do this, but was error-prone. A new entry called `pinned_dependencies` was added to pyproject.toml to specify the release dependencies. See [PR #760](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/760).

## Version 1.3.0 (November 15, 2024)

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/1.2.0...1.3.0). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Introduced Support for Python 3.13 and Dropped Support for Python 3.9

- In line with other scientific Python packages, `scores` has dropped support for Python 3.9 in this release. 
  `scores` has added support for Python 3.13. See [PR #710](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/710).

### Features

- Added four new metrics:
	- Quantile Interval Score: `scores.continuous.quantile_interval_score`. See [PR #704](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/704), [PR #733](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/733) and [PR #738](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/738).
	- Interval Score: `scores.continuous.interval_score`. See [PR #704](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/704), [PR #733](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/733) and [PR #738](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/738).
	- Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE): `scores.continuous.kge`. See [PR #679](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/679), [PR #700](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/700) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734). 
	- Interval threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.interval_tw_crps_for_ensemble`. See [PR #682](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/682) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734).
- Added an optional `include_components` argument to several continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) functions for ensembles. If supplied, the `include_components` argument will return the underforecast penalty, the overforecast penalty and the forecast spread term, in addition to the overall CRPS value. This applies to the following CRPS functions:
	- continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.crps_for_ensemble`
	- threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.tw_crps_for_ensemble`
	- tail threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.tail_tw_crps_for_ensemble`
	- interval threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.interval_tw_crps_for_ensemble`)  
	See [PR #708](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/708) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734).
	
### Documentation

- Added "Threshold Weighted Continuous Ranked Probability Score (twCRPS) for ensembles" tutorial. See [PR #706](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/706) and [PR #722](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/722).
- Updated the title in the "Binary Categorical Scores and Binary Contingency Tables (Confusion Matrices)" tutorial and the description for the corresponding thumbnail in the tutorial gallery. See [PR #741](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/741) and [PR #743](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/743).
- Updated the pull request template. See [PR #719](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/719).

### Internal Changes

## Version 1.2.0 (September 13, 2024) 

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Features

- Added three new metrics:
	- Percent bias (PBIAS): `scores.continuous.pbias`. See [PR #639](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/639) and [PR #655](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/655).

## Version 1.0.0 (July 10, 2024)

We are happy to have reached the point of releasing “Version 1.0.0” of `scores`. While we look forward to many version increments to come, version 1.0.0 represents a milestone. It signifies a stabilisation of the API, and marks a turning point from the initial construction period. We have also published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06889) in the Journal of Open Source Software (see citation further below).

From this point forward, `scores` will be following the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) in its release management. 

This is a good moment to acknowledge and thank the contributors that helped us reach this point. They are: Tennessee Leeuwenburg, Nicholas Loveday, Elizabeth E. Ebert, Harrison Cook, Mohammadreza Khanarmuei, Robert J. Taggart, Nikeeth Ramanathan, Maree Carroll, Stephanie Chong, Aidan Griffiths and John Sharples.
