## Version 2.2.0 (Upcoming Release)

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/2.1.0...develop). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Breaking Changes

Nil currently.

### Deprecations

Nil currently.

### Features

- Added a new metric:
	- Spearman’s correlation coefficient: `scores.continuous.correlation.spearmanr`. See [PR #773](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/773).
- Added a new function for generating data for diagrams
    - Quantile-Quantile (qq) plots: `scores.plotdata.qq`. See [PR #852](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/852)
- The FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score (`scores.categorical.firm`) now has support for xr.Datasets in addition to the existing support for xr.DataArrays. See [PR #853](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/853).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the `scores.plotdata.roc` doesn't add the point (0, 0) in some instances. See [PR #863](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/863)

### Documentation

- Added "Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient" tutorial. See [PR #773](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/773).
- Substantially updated "The FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) Score" tutorial. See [PR #853](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/853).
- Updated the FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score (`scores.categorical.firm`) docstring, including adding an example. See [PR #853](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/853). 	
- Fixed an error in the formula in the docstring for the quantile interval score (`scores.continuous.quantile_interval_score`). (*Note:* this error was only present in the docstring - the code implemenation of the function was correct and the tutorial listed the correct formula.) See [PR #851](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/851).
- Updated several "full changelog" URLs in the release notes. See [PR #859](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/859).

### Internal Changes

- Improved the efficiency of the FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score (`scores.categorical.firm`) by moving the call to gather dimensions to earlier within the method. See [PR #853](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/853).
- Added `scores.plotdata` for functions that generate data for verification plots. `scores.probability.roc_curve_data` was moved to `scores.plotdata.roc`, but can still be imported as `scores.probability.roc_curve_data`. `scores.continuous.murphy_score` and `scores.continuous.murphy_thetas` were also moved to `scores.plotdata.murphy_score` and `scores.plotdata.murphy_thetas`respectively, but can still be imported as `scores.continuous.murphy_score` and `scores.continuous.murphy_thetas`.

## Version 2.1.0 (April 30, 2025)

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Features

- Added a new fuction:
	- Block bootstrap: `scores.processing.block_bootstrap`. See [PR #418](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/418).
- Added two new metrics:
	- Stable equitable error in probability space (SEEPS): `scores.categorical.seeps`. See [PR #809](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/809) and [PR #833](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/833).
	- Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE): `scores.continuous.nse`. See [PR #815](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/815).

### Documentation

- Added "Block Bootstrapping" tutorial. See [PR #418](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/418). 
- Added "Stable Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS)" tutorial. See [PR #809](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/809).
- Added "Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)" tutorial. See [PR #815](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/815).
- Updated the "Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for Ensembles" tutorial:
	- Labelled dimensions in fcst/obs data.
	- Updated description of the plot to say the area squared corresponds to the CRPS.
	- Added an example with multiple coordinates along a dimension.  
	See [PR #805](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/805).
- Updated "Data Sources":
	- Added links to two additional datasets for gridded global numerical weather prediction.
	- Added links to several additional datasets for point-based data.  
	See [PR #823](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/823) and [PR #831](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/831). 
- Updated references in several sections of the documentation, following the publication of a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.08891) for the risk matrix score. See [PR #827](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/827).

### Internal Changes

- Tested and added compatibility for recent Xarray versions (2025 and onwards) and adjusted dependency specification so new year "major version" rollovers will be permitted by default in future. See [commit #f109f2f](https://github.com/nci/scores/commit/f109f2f434ac684b3d54f447c330466d33703279) and [commit #8428d64](https://github.com/nci/scores/commit/8428d64dcf2a5f5480c61b266284260d4b5078d2).
- In `scores.emerging.weights_from_warning_scaling`, changed the name of the argument `assessment_weights` to  `evaluation_weights`. See [PR #806](https://github.com/nci/scores/issues/806).  
***Note:** This is technically a breaking change, but does not trigger a major release as it is contained within the "emerging" section of the API. This area of the API is designated for metrics which are still undergoing peer review and as such are expected to undergo change. Once peer review is concluded, the implementation will be finalised and moved.*
- Add support for developers of `scores` who choose to use the `pixi` tool for environment management. See [PR #835](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/835), [PR #839](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/839) and [PR #840](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/840).

## Version 2.0.0 (December 7, 2024)

For a list of all changes in this release, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/1.3.0...2.0.0). Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.

### Breaking Changes

- The function `scores.probability.tw_crps_for_ensemble` previously took an optional (mis-spelled) argument `chainging_func_kwargs`. The spelling has been corrected and the argument is now `chaining_func_kwargs`. See [PR #780](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/780) and [PR #772](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/772).
- For those who develop on `scores`, you will need to update your installation of the `scores` package with `pip install -e .[all]`, to get updated versions of `black`, `pylint` and `mypy`. See [PR #768](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/768), [PR #769](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/769) and [PR #771](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/771).

### Features

- Added three new metrics:
	- Brier score for ensembles: `scores.probability.brier_score_for_ensemble`. See [PR #735](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/735).
	- Negative predictive value: `scores.categorical.BasicContingencyManager.negative_predictive_value`. See [PR #759](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/759).
	- Positive predictive value: `scores.categorical.BasicContingencyManager.positive_predictive_value`. See [PR #761](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/761) and [PR #756](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/756).
- Also added one new emerging metric and two supporting functions:
	- Risk matrix score: `scores.emerging.risk_matrix_scores`.
	- Risk matrix score - matrix weights to array: `scores.emerging.matrix_weights_to_array`.
	- Risk matrix score - warning scaling to weight array: `scores.emerging.weights_from_warning_scaling`.  
	See [PR #724](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/724) and [PR #794](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/794).  
- A new method called `format_table` was added to the class `BasicContingencyManager` to improve visualisation of 2x2 contingency tables. The tutorial `Binary_Contingency_Scores` was updated to demonstrate the use of this function. See [PR #775](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/775).
- The functions `scores.processing.comparative_discretise`, `scores.processing.binary_discretise` and `scores.processing.binary_discretise_proportion` now accept either a string indicating the choice of operator to be used, or an operator from the [Python core library `operator` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html). Using one of the operators from the Python core module is recommended, as doing so is more reliable for a variety of reasons. Support for the use of a string may be removed in future. See [PR #740](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/740) and [PR #758](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/758).

### Documentation

- Added "The Risk Matrix Score" tutorial. See [PR #724](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/724) and [PR #794](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/794). 
- Updated the "Brier Score" tutorial to include a new section about the Brier score for ensembles. See [PR #735](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/735).
- Updated the "Binary Categorical Scores and Binary Contingency Tables (Confusion Matrices)" 
  tutorial:
  - Included "positive predictive value" in the list of binary categorical scores.
  - Included "negative predictive value" in the list of binary categorical scores.
  - Demonstrated the use of the new `format_table` method for visualising 2x2 contingency tables.  
  See [PR #759](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/759) and [PR #775](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/775). 
- Updated the “Contributing Guide”:
	- Added a new section: "Creating Your Own Fork of `scores` for the First Time".
	- Updated the section: "Workflow for Submitting Pull Requests".
	- Added a new section: "Pull Request Etiquette".  
	See [PR #787](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/787).
- Updated the README:
	- Added a link to a video of a PyCon AU 2024 conference presentation about `scores`. See [PR #783](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/783).
	- Added a link to the archives of `scores` on Zenodo. See [PR #784](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/784).
- Added `Scoringrules` to "Related Works". See [PR #746](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/746), [PR #766](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/766) and [PR #789](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/789).

### Internal Changes

- Removed scikit-learn as a dependency. `scores` has replaced the use of scikit-learn with a similar function from SciPy (which was an existing `scores` dependency). This change was manually tested and found to be faster. See [PR #774](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/774).
- Version pinning of dependencies in release files (the wheel and sdist files used by PyPI and conda-forge) is now managed and set by the `hatch_build` script. This allows development versions to be free-floating, while being more specific about dependencies in releases. The previous process also aimed to do this, but was error-prone. A new entry called `pinned_dependencies` was added to pyproject.toml to specify the release dependencies. See [PR #760](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/760).

	- Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE): `scores.continuous.kge`. See [PR #679](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/679), [PR #700](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/700) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734). 
	- Interval threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.interval_tw_crps_for_ensemble`. See [PR #682](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/682) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734).
- Added an optional `include_components` argument to several continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) functions for ensembles. If supplied, the `include_components` argument will return the underforecast penalty, the overforecast penalty and the forecast spread term, in addition to the overall CRPS value. This applies to the following CRPS functions:
	- continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.crps_for_ensemble`
	- threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.tw_crps_for_ensemble`
	- tail threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.tail_tw_crps_for_ensemble`
	- interval threshold weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS) for ensembles: `scores.probability.interval_tw_crps_for_ensemble`)  
	See [PR #708](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/708) and [PR #734](https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/734).
	
### Documentation

## Version 1.0.0 (July 10, 2024)

We are happy to have reached the point of releasing “Version 1.0.0” of `scores`. While we look forward to many version increments to come, version 1.0.0 represents a milestone. It signifies a stabilisation of the API, and marks a turning point from the initial construction period. We have also published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06889) in the Journal of Open Source Software (see citation further below).

From this point forward, `scores` will be following the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) in its release management. 

This is a good moment to acknowledge and thank the contributors that helped us reach this point. They are: Tennessee Leeuwenburg, Nicholas Loveday, Elizabeth E. Ebert, Harrison Cook, Mohammadreza Khanarmuei, Robert J. Taggart, Nikeeth Ramanathan, Maree Carroll, Stephanie Chong, Aidan Griffiths and John Sharples.
