    """
    Calculates the Brier score for an ensemble forecast for the provided thresholds. By default,
    the fair Brier score is calculated, which is a modified version of the Brier score that
    applies a correction related to the number of ensemble members and the number of
    ensemble members that predict the event.

    The fair Brier score for ensembles is defined for a single event threshold as:


    .. math::
        s_{i,y} = \\left(\\frac{i}{m} - y\\right)^2 - \\frac{i(m-i)}{m^2(m-1)}

    Where:

    - :math:`i` is the number of ensemble members that predict the event
    - :math:`m` is the total number of ensemble members
    - :math:`y` is the observed event

    When the fair correction is not applied (i.e., ``fair_correction=False``),
    the Brier score is calculated as:


    .. math::
        s_{i,y} = \\left(\\frac{i}{m} - y\\right)^2

    If ``fair_correction`` is set to ``True`` and the number of ensemble members is 1, the
    fair correction will not be applied to avoid division by zero. If you want to
    set the minimum number ensemble members required to calculate the Brier score,
    we recommend preprocessing your data to remove data points with fewer than the
    minimum number of ensemble members that you want.

    Args:
        fcst: Forecast or predicted variables in xarray.
        obs: Observed variables in xarray.
        ensemble_member_dim: The dimension name of the ensemble member.
        thresholds: The threshold(s) to use for the Brier score that define what is
            considered an event. If multiple thresholds are provided, they should
            be monotonically increasing with no NaNs
        reduce_dims: Optionally specify which dimensions to reduce when
            calculating the Brier score. All other dimensions will be preserved.
        preserve_dims: Optionally specify which dimensions to preserve when
            calculating the Fair Brier score. All other dimensions will be reduced. As a
            special case, 'all' will allow all dimensions to be preserved. In
            this case, the result will be in the same shape/dimensionality
            as the forecast, and the errors will be the absolute error at each
            point (i.e. single-value comparison against observed), and the
            forecast and observed dimensions must match precisely.
        weights: Optionally provide an array for weighted averaging (e.g. by area, by latitude,
            by population, custom).
        fair_correction: Whether or not to apply the fair Brier score correction. Default is True.
        threshold_mode: The mode to use when determining threshold exceedance. Default is '>='
            which means that the threshold is exceeded if the forecast is greater than or equal
            to the threshold. Alternatively, you can provide ``threshold_mode='>'` which means
            that the threshold is exceeded if the forecast is strictly greater than the threshold.


    Returns:
        The Brier score for the ensemble forecast.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if values in ``thresholds`` are not monotonically increasing.
        ValueError: if ``fcst`` contains the dimension 'threshold'.
        ValueError: if ``obs`` contains the dimension 'threshold'.
        ValueError: if ``weights`` contains the dimension 'threshold'.
        ValueError: if ``ensemble_member_dim`` is 'threshold'.
        ValueError: if ``ensemble_member_dim`` is not in ``fcst`` dimensions.
