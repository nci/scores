    """Calculates CRPS CDF probabilistic metric.

    Calculates the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), or the mean CRPS over
    specified dimensions, given forecasts in the form of predictive cumulative
    distribution functions (CDFs). Can also calculate threshold-weighted versions of the
    CRPS by supplying a `threshold_weight`.

    Predictive CDFs here are described by an indexed set of values rather than by
    closed forumulae. As a result, the resolution or number of points at which the CDF
    is realised has an impact on the calculation of areas under and over the curve to
    obtain the CRPS result. The term 'threshold' is used to describe the dimension which
    is used as an index for predictive CDF values. Various techniques are used to
    interpolate CDF values between indexed thresholds.

    Given
        - a predictive CDF `fcst` indexed at thresholds by variable x,
        - an observation in CDF form `obs_cdf` (i.e., obs_cdf(x) = 0 if x < obs and 1 if x >= obs),
        - a `threshold_weight` array indexed by variable x,

    The threshold-weighted CRPS is given by:
        `CRPS = integral(threshold_weight(x) * (fcst(x) - obs_cdf(x))**2)`, over all thresholds x.
    The usual CRPS is the threshold-weighted CRPS with `threshold_weight(x) = 1` for all x.
    This can be decomposed into an over-forecast penalty
        `integral(threshold_weight(x) * (fcst(x) - obs_cdf(x))**2)`, over all thresholds x where x >= obs
    and an under-forecast penalty
        `integral(threshold_weight(x) * (fcst(x) - obs_cdf(x))**2)`, over all thresholds x where x <= obs.

    Note that the function `crps_cdf` is designed so that the `obs` argument contains
    actual observed values. `crps_cdf` will convert `obs` into CDF form in order to
    calculate the CRPS.

    To calculate CRPS, integration is applied over the set of thresholds x taken from
        - `fcst[threshold_dim].values`,
        - `obs.values`.
        - `threshold_weight[threshold_dim].values` if applicable.
        - `additional_thresholds` if applicable.
    With NaN values excluded. There are two methods of integration:
        - "exact" gives the exact integral under that assumption that that `fcst` is
          continuous and piecewise linear between its specified values, and that
          `threshold_weight` (if supplied) is piecewise constant and right-continuous
          between its specified values.
        - "trapz" simply uses a trapezoidal rule using the specified values, and so is
          an approximation of the CRPS. To get an accurate approximation, the density
          of threshold values can be increased by supplying `additional_thresholds`.

    Both methods of calculating CRPS may require adding additional values to the
    `threshold_dim` dimension in `fcst` and (if supplied) `threshold_weight`.
    `fcst_fill_method` and `weight_fill_method` specify how `fcst` and `weight` are to
    be filled at these additional points.

    The function `crps_cdf` calculates the CRPS using forecast CDF values 'as is'.
    No checks are performed to ensure that CDF values in `fcst` are nondecreasing along
    `threshold_dim`. Checks are conducted on `fcst` and `threshold_weight` (if applicable)
    to ensure that coordinates are increasing along `threshold_dim`.

    Args:
        fcst: array of forecast CDFs, with the threshold dimension given by `threshold_dim`.
        obs: array of observations, not in CDF form.
        threshold_dim: name of the dimension in `fcst` that indexes the thresholds.
        threshold_weight: weight to be applied along `threshold_dim` to calculat
            threshold-weighted CRPS. Must contain `threshold_dim` as a dimension, and may
            also include other dimensions from `fcst`. If `weight=None`, a weight of 1
            is applied everywhere, which gives the usual CRPS.
        additional_thresholds: additional thresholds values to add to `fcst` and (if
            applicable) `threshold_weight` prior to calculating CRPS.
        propagate_nans: If `True`, propagate NaN values along `threshold_dim` in `fcst`
            and `threshold_weight` prior to calculating CRPS. This will result in CRPS
            being NaN for these cases. If `False`, NaN values in `fcst` and `weight` will
            be replaced, wherever possible, with non-NaN values using the fill method
            specified by `fcst_fill_method` and `threshold_weight_fill_method`.
        fcst_fill_method: how to fill values in `fcst` when NaNs have been introduced
            (by including additional thresholds) or are specified to be removed (by
            setting `propagate_nans=False`). Select one of:
                - "linear": use linear interpolation, then replace any leading or
                  trailing NaNs using linear extrapolation. Afterwards, all values are
                  clipped to the closed interval [0, 1].
                - "step": apply forward filling, then replace any leading NaNs with 0.
                - "forward": first apply forward filling, then remove any leading NaNs by
                  back filling.
                - "backward": first apply back filling, then remove any trailing NaNs by
                  forward filling.
            In most cases, "linear" is likely the appropriate choice.
        threshold_weight_fill_method: how to fill values in `threshold_weight` when NaNs
            have been introduced (by including additional thresholds) or are specified
            to be removed (by setting `propagate_nans=False`). Select one of "linear",
            "step", "forward" or "backward". If the weight function is continuous,
            "linear" is probably the best choice. If it is an increasing step function,
            "forward" may be best.
        integration_method (str): one of "exact" or "trapz".
        preserve_dims (Tuple[str]): dimensions to preserve in the output. All other dimensions are collapsed
            by taking the mean.
        reduce_dims (Tuple[str]): dimensions to reduce in the output by taking the mean. All other dimensions are
            preserved.
        weights: Not yet implemented. Allow weighted averaging (e.g. by area, by latitude, by population, custom)
        include_components (bool): if True, include the under and over forecast components of
            the score in the returned dataset.

    Returns:
        xr.Dataset: The following are the produced Dataset variables:
            - "total" the total CRPS.
            - "underforecast_penalty": the under-forecast penalty contribution of the CRPS.
            - "overforecast_penalty": the over-forecast penalty contribution of the CRPS.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if `threshold_dim` is not a dimension of `fcst`.

    This function takes a forecast cumulative distribution functions (CDF) `fcst`.
    If `fcst` is not decreasing outside of specified tolerance, it returns `fcst`.
    Otherwise, the CDF envelope for `fcst` is computed, and the CDF from among
        - `fcst`,
        - the upper envelope, and
        - the lower envelope
    that has the higher (i.e. worse) CRPS is returned. In the event of a tie,
    preference is given in the order `fcst` then upper.
    See `scores.probability.functions.cdf_envelope` for details about the CDF envelope.

    The use case for this is when, either due to rounding or poor forecast process, the
    forecast CDF `fcst` fails to be nondecreasing. Rather than simply replacing `fcst`
    with NaN, `adjust_fcst_for_crps` returns a CDF for which CRPS can be calculated, but
    possibly with a predictive performance cost as measured by CRPS.

    Whether a CDF is decreasing outside specified tolerance is determined as follows.
    For each CDF in `fcst`, the sum of incremental decreases along the threshold dimension
    is calculated. For example, if the CDF values are
        [0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.9, 0.88, 1]
    then the sum of incremental decreases is -0.12. This CDF decreases outside specified
    tolerance if 0.12 > `decreasing_tolerance`.

    The adjusted array of forecast CDFs is determined as follows:
        - any NaN values in `fcst` are propagated along `threshold_dim` so that in each case
            the entire CDF is NaN;
        - any CDFs in `fcst` that are decreasing within specified tolerance are unchanged;
        - any CDFs in `fcst` that are decreasing outside specified tolerance are replaced with
            whichever of the upper or lower CDF envelope gives the highest CRPS, unless the original
            values give a higher CRPS in which case original values are kept.
    See `scores.probability.functions.cdf_envelope` for a description of the 'CDF envelope'.
    If propagating NaNs is not desired, the user may first fill NaNs in `fcst` using
    `scores.probability.functions.fill_cdf`.
    The CRPS for each forecast case is calculated using `crps`, with a weight of 1.

    Args:
        fcst: DataArray of CDF values with threshold dimension `threshold_dim`.
        threshold_dim: name of the threshold dimension in `fcst`.

        decreasing_tolerance: nonnegative tolerance value.

    Returns:
        An xarray DataArray of possibly adjusted forecast CDFs, where adjustments are made
        to penalise CDFs that decrease outside tolerance.

        ValueError: If `threshold_dim` is not a dimension of `fcst`.
        ValueError: If `decreasing_tolerance` is negative.
