Sample implementation of block bootstrapping.

.. note::

    currently only does a single bootstrap iteration on a single numpy array.

TODO:
    - support for xarray
    - support for multiple array inputs of with different subset of axes
    - expand dims with multiple bootstrap iterations
    - support for dask & chunking
    - match api call with ``xbootstrap`` for ease of transition for existing code that relies on it

        ax_1 = [5]
        ax_2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
        ax_3 = [4,0]

    which will result in the following multi indices from the input array,

    .. code-block::

        [4,5,1,4], [4,5,1,0], [4,5,2,4] ... [6,5,5,4], [6,5,5,0]

    this can be mapped to the following block in the output array:

    .. code-block::

        output_arr[1:4, 2:3, 0:5, 3:5]

    .. note::
