    Calculate the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) between observed and simulated (or forecast) values.

    KGE is a performance metric that decomposes the error into three components:
    correlation, variability, and bias.
    It is computed as:

    .. math::
        \\text{KGE} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\left[s_\\rho \\cdot (\\rho - 1)\\right]^2 +
        \\left[s_\\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha - 1)\\right]^2 + \\left[s_\\beta \\cdot (\\beta - 1)\\right]^2}

        \\beta = \\frac{\\mu_x}{\\mu_y}

    where:
        - :math:`\\rho`  = Pearson's correlation coefficient between observed and forecast values as defined in 'scores.continuous.correlation.pearsonr'
        - :math:`\\alpha` is the ratio of the standard deviations (variability ratio)
        - :math:`\\beta` is the ratio of the means (bias)
        - :math:`x` and :math:`y` are forecast and observed values, respectively
        - :math:`\\mu_x` and :math:`\\mu_y` are the means of forecast and observed values, respectively
        - :math:`\\sigma_x` and :math:`\\sigma_y` are the standard deviations of forecast and observed values, respectively
        - :math:`s_\\rho`, :math:`s_\\alpha` and :math:`s_\\beta` are the scaling factors for the correlation coefficient :math:`\\rho`,
            the variability term :math:`\\alpha` and the bias term :math:`\\beta`

            the variability term :math:`\\alpha` and the bias term :math:`\\beta` respectively. Defaults to (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). (*See
            equation 10 in Gupta et al. (2009) for definitions of them*)
        return_components (bool | False): If True, the function also returns the individual terms contributing to the KGE score.

    Returns:
        The Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) score as an xarray DataArray.

        If ``return_components`` is True, the function returns ``xarray.Dataset`` kge_s with the following variables:

        - `kge`: The KGE score.
        - `rho`: The Pearson correlation coefficient.
        - `alpha`: The variability ratio.
        - `beta`: The bias term.

        - Statistics are calculated only from values for which both observations and
          simulations are not null values.
        - This function isn't set up to take weights.
        - Currently this function is working only on xr.DataArray
        - When preserve_dims is set to 'all', the function returns NaN,
          similar to the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation for a single data point
          because the standard deviation is zero for a single point

    Examples:
        >>> kge_s = kge(forecasts, obs,preserve_dims='lat')  # if data is of dimension {lat,time}, kge value is computed across the time dimension
        >>> kge_s = kge(forecasts, obs,reduce_dims="time")  # if data is of dimension {lat,time}, reduce_dims="time" is same as preserve_dims='lat'
        >>> kge_s = kge(forecasts, obs, return_components=True) # kge_s is dataset of all three components and kge value itself
        >>> kge_s_weighted = kge(forecasts, obs, scaling_factors=(0.5, 1.0, 2.0)) # with scaling factors
