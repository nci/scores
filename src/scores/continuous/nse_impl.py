    """
    The Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency coefficient (NSE) is primarily used in hydrology to assess
    the skill of model predictions (of e.g. "discharge").

    While NSE is often calculated over observations and model predictions in the time dimension, it
    is actually a fairly generic statistical measure that determines the relative magnitude of the
    residual variance ("noise") compared to the measured data variance ("information") (Nash and
    Sutcliffe, 1970). Incidentally, it is (inversely) related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

    The general formulation of NSE is as follows:

    .. math::

        \\text{NSE} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_i{(O_i - S_i)^2}}{\\sum_i{(O_i - \\bar{O})^2}}

    where
        - :math:`i` is a generic "indexer" representing the set of datapoints along the dimensions
          being reduced e.g. time (:math:`t`) or xy-coordinates (:math:`(x, y)`). The latter
          represents reduction over two dimensions as an example.
        - :math:`O_i` is the observation at the :math:`\\text{i^{th}}` index.
        - :math:`S_i` is the "forecast" or model simulation at the :math:`\\text{i^{th}}` index.
        - :math:`\\bar{O}` is the mean observation of the set of indexed samples as specified by
          ``reduce_dims`` and ``preserve_dims``.

    Args:
        fcst: "Forecast" or predicted variables.
        obs: Observed variables.
        reduce_dims: dimensions to reduce when calculating the NSE. (i.e. NSE will be calculated
            using datapoints along these dimensions as samples, the other dimensions will be
            preserved).
        preserve_dims: dimensions to preserve. Mutually exclusive to ``reduce_dims``. All
            dimensions not specified here will be reduced as described in ``reduce_dims``.
            Note: ``preserve_dims="all"`` is not supported for NSE. See notes below.
        weights: Optional weighting to apply to the NSE computation. Typically weights are applied
            over `time_dim` but can vary by location as well. Weights must be non-negative and
            specified for each data point _(i.e. the user must not assume broadcasting will handle
            appropriate assignment of weights for this score)_.
        is_angular: specifies whether `fcst` and `obs` are angular data (e.g. wind direction). If
            True, a different function is used to calculate the difference between `fcst` and `obs`,
            which accounts for circularity. Angular `fcst` and `obs` data should be in degrees
            rather than radians.

    Returns:
        ``XarrayLike`` containing the NSE score for each preserved dimension.

    Raises:
        DimensionError: If any dimension checks fail.
        KeyError: If no dimensions are being reduced - NSE requries at least 1 dimension to be
            reduced to compute obs variance.
        IndexError: If the dimensions being reduced only have 1 value - not sufficient for
            computation of obs variance.
        UserWarning: If weights are negative, or invalid (e.g. all zeros or all NaNs).
        UserWarning: If attempting to divide by 0. The computation will still succeed but produce
            ``np.nan`` (numerator is also 0) or ``-np.inf`` where divide by zero would occur.
        Exception: Any other errors or warnings not otherwise listed due to calculations associated
            with utility functions such as `gather_dimensions`.
        RuntimeError: If something went wrong with the underlying implementation. The user will be
            prompted to report this as a github issue.

    Supplementary details:

        - Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies range from -Inf to 1. Essentially, the closer to 1, the more
          accurate the model is.
            - NSE = 1, corresponds to a perfect match of the model to the obs.
            - NSE = 0, indicates that the model is as accurate as the mean obs.
            - -Inf < NSE < 0, indicates that the mean obs is better predictor than the model.

        - The optional ``weights`` argument can additionally be used to perform a weighted NSE
          (wNSE). Although, this is a generic set of weights, and it is the _user's responsiblility_
          to define them appropriately. Typically this is the observation itself (Hundecha, Y., &
          BÃ¡rdossy, A., 2004).

        - ``weights`` must be non-negative. Therefore, the observations must ideally also be
          non-negative (or formulated appropriately) if used as weights.

        - While ``is_angular`` is typically not used for this score, NSE is generic enough that it
          _could_ be used in wider context, and hence is kept as an option. It is defaulted to
          ``False`` as that's the typical use-case.

    .. important::

        This score does not allow mixed xarray data structures as inputs. Either provide all
        ``xr.DataArray`` or all ``xr.Dataset`` exclusively, for the ``fcst``, ``obs`` and
        (optionally) ``weights`` arguments.

        This is an intentionally imposed constraint to make sure the inner computations are simple
        to check and deterministic. See tips below for more information.

    .. warning::

        Operations between dataarrays are not guarenteed to preserve names. If the user is
        working with dataarrays, it is assumed that preserving names is not a major requirement. If
        a user needs the name preserved, they should explicitly convert all data array inputs to
        datasets using `xr.DataArray.to_dataset(...)` , and verify that the naming is retained
        appropriately before calling the score.

        For operations where ONLY ``xr.DataArray`` inputs are used, the returned score will have its
        name forced to the name of this score i.e. "NSE", for simplicity.

        See tips below for more information.

    .. note::

        For Hydrology in particular :math:`i = t` - the reduced dimension is usually the time
        dimension. However, in order to keep things generic, this function does not explicitly
        mandate a time dimension be provided. Instead it requires it has a hard requirement that _at
        least one_ dimension is being reduced from either a specification of ``reduce_dims`` or
        ``preserve_dims`` (mutually exclusive).

        The reason is that the observation variance cannot be non-zero if nothing is being reduced.

        As a side-effect of the above requirement, ``preserve_dims="all"`` is not allowed and will
        naturally throw an error.

    .. note::

        Divide by zero is ALLOWED - to accomodate scenarios where all obs entries in the group being
        reduced is constant (0 obs variance).

        While these may cause divide by zero errors, they should not halt execution of computations
        for other valid coordinates - so a warning is issued instead to prompt the user to double
        check the data.

        It may also be that divide by zero is unavoidable - in which case we still want to return
        the correctly calculated values. To this end, this is how ``numpy`` resolves divide by zero:

        .. code-block::

            n / 0  =  NaN   : if n == 0  (represented by np.nan)
                   = -Inf   : if n == 0  (represented by -np.inf)

    .. tip::

        When dealing with dask arrays dask, no computation will happen until ``.compute(...)`` is
        called on the returned score.

    .. tip::

        Work with datasets where possible with NSE, or for any score that supports datasets for that
        matter. Datasets maintain structural integrity better than their dataarray counterparts and
        also are compatible with higher order types like `xr.DataTree`.

        Operations between datasets are more predictable than operations with mixed types.
        Dataarrays on the other hand may ignore names and broadcast liberally even when names do not
        match, and this may not be consistent depending on the oepration. This may or may not be the
        intented behaviour the user expects.  Operations between ONLY dataarrays are fine as long as
        preserving names is not mandatory.

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import xarray as xr
        >>> from scores.continuous import nse
        >>> obs_raw = np.array(

        ...         [[3,2,5], [2,2,6]],
        ...         [[5,2,3], [4,-1,4]],
        ...     ]
        ...
        ... )  # dimension lengths: x=4, y=2, t=3
        >>> obs = xr.DataArray(obs_raw, dims=["x", "y", "t"])
        >>> fcst = obs * 1.2 + 0.1  # add some synthetic bias and variance
        >>> # Example 1:
        >>> # reduce over t - time - should produce a 4x2 array representing the xy coordinate grid
        >>> nse(obs, fcst, reduce_dims=["t"])
        <xarray.DataArray (x: 4, y: 2)> Size: 64B
        array([[ 0.71180556, -0.28819444],
