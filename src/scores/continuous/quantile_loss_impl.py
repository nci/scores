    Calculates a score that targets alpha-quantiles.
    Use with alpha = 0.5 for forecasts of the median.
    Use with alpha = 0.9 for forecasts of the 90th percentile.

    Args:
        fcst: array of forecasts
        obs: array of observations
        alpha: A value between 0 and 1 (exclusive)
        reduce_dims: Optionally specify which dimensions to reduce when
            calculating the quantile score. All other dimensions will be preserved. As a
            special case, 'all' will allow all dimensions to be reduced. Only one
            of `reduce_dims` and `preserve_dims` can be supplied. The default behaviour
            if neither are supplied is to reduce all dims.
        preserve_dims: Optionally specify which dimensions to preserve when calculating
            quantile score. All other dimensions will be reduced. As a special case, 'all'
            will allow all dimensions to be preserved. In this case, the result will be in
            the same shape/dimensionality as the forecast, and the errors will be the quantile
            score at each point (i.e. single-value comparison against observed), and the
            forecast and observed dimensions must match precisely. Only one of `reduce_dims`
            and `preserve_dims` can be supplied. The default behaviour if neither are supplied
            is to reduce all dims.
        weights: Optionally provide an array for weighted averaging (e.g. by area, by latitude,
            by population, custom)

    Returns:
        A DataArray with values being the mean generalised piecewise linear (GPL)
        scoring function, with the dimensions specified in `dims`.
        If `dims` is `None`, the returned DataArray will have only one element,
        the overall mean GPL score.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if `alpha` is not between 0 and 1.

    Notes:

        .. math::

            gpl(x) = \\begin{cases}\\alpha * (-x) & x \\leq 0\\\\
           (1-\\alpha) x & x > 0\\end{cases}

        where:

            - :math:`\\alpha` is the targeted quantile.
            - :math:`x` is the difference, fcst - obs
