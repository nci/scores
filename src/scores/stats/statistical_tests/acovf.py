"""
Estimate autocovariances

Barebones reimplementation of the `acovf` from `statsmodels.api.tsa.acovf`, 
for use only with `scores.stats.test.diebold_mariano`

Package: https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/

Code reference: https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/main/statsmodels/tsa/stattools.py

Notes:
    All type checking and other features have been removed, as they aren't needed for the 
    `diebold_mariano` function.

Why:
    Reduce dependant packages
