    """
    Computes a weighted or unweighted aggregation of the input data across specified dimensions.
    The input data is typically the "score" at each point.

    This function applies a mean reduction or a sum over the dimensions given by ``reduce_dims`` on
    the input ``values``, optionally using weights to compute a weighted mean. Weighting
    is performed using xarray's `.weighted()` method. The `method` arg specifies if you
    want to produce a weighted mean or weighted sum.

    If `reduce_dims` is None, no reduction is performed and the original `values` are
    returned unchanged.

    If `weights` is None, an unweighted mean is computed. If weights are provided, negative
    weights are not allowed and will raise a `ValueError`.

    If weights are provided but `reduce_dims` is None (i.e., no reduction), a `UserWarning`
    is emitted since the weights will be ignored.

    Weights must not contain NaN values. Missing values can be filled by ``weights.fillna(0)``
    if you would like to assign a weight of zero to those points (e.g., masking).

    Args:
        values: Input data to be reduced. Typically an `xr.DataArray` or `xr.Dataset`.
        reduce_dims: Dimensions over which to apply the mean. Can be a string, list of
            strings, or None. If None, no reduction is performed.ÃŸ
        weights: Weights to apply for weighted averaging.
            Must be broadcastable to `values` and contain no negative values. If None,
            an unweighted mean is calculated. Defaults to None.
        method: Aggregation method to use. Either "mean" or "sum". Defaults to "mean".

    Returns:
        An xarray object (same type as the input) with (un)weighted mean or sum of ``values``

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `weights` contains any negative values.
        ValueError: if `weights` contains any NaN values
        ValueError: if `method` is not 'mean' or 'sum'
        ValueError: if `weights` is an xr.Dataset when `values` is an xr.DataArray
        NotImplementedError: if `method` is sum and weights is an xr.Dataset

    Warnings:
        UserWarning: If weights are provided but no reduction is performed (`reduce_dims` is None),
        a warning is issued since weights are ignored.

    Examples:
        >>> import xarray as xr
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3), dims=['x', 'y'])
        >>> weights = xr.DataArray([1, 2], dims=['x'])
        >>> apply_weighted_mean(da, reduce_dims=['x'], weights=weights)
