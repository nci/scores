"""
This module contains methods related to the Fractions Skill Score (FSS).

For an explanation of the FSS, and implementation considerations, see references below.

Currently uses the default score defined Robert and Leans (2008) :sup:`[1,2]`. Fine grained controls are considered in `#353 <GITHUB353_>`_.

The default computation is performed using`numpy` :sup:`[3]` and summed-area tables, with future optimization options considered in:
- `#269 <GITHUB269_>`_.
- `#270 <GITHUB270_>`_.

    """
    Uses :py:func:`fss_2d_single_field` to compute the Fractions Skill Score (FSS) for each 2D
    spatial field in the DataArray and then aggregates them over the output of gather dimensions.

    The aggregation method is the intended extension of the score defined by Robert and Leans (2008)
    for multiple forecasts :sup:`[1,2]`

    .. note::
        This method takes in a ``threshold_operator`` to compare the input
        fields against the ``event_threshold`` which defaults to ``numpy.greater``,
        and is compatible with lightweight numpy operators. If you would
        like to do more advanced binary discretization consider doing this
        separately and using :py:func:`scores.spatial.fss_2d_binary` instead, which takes in a
        pre-discretized binary field.

    Optionally aggregates the output along other dimensions if `reduce_dims` or
    (mutually exclusive) ``preserve_dims`` are specified.

    For implementation for a single 2-D field,
    see: :py:func:`fss_2d_single_field`. This offers the user the ability to use
    their own aggregation methods, rather than ``xarray.ufunc``

    .. warning::
        ``dask`` option is not fully tested

    Args:
        fcst: An array of forecasts
        obs: An array of observations (same spatial shape as ``fcst``)
        event_threshold: A scalar to compare ``fcst`` and ``obs`` fields to generate a
            binary "event" field.
        window_size: A pair of positive integers ``(height, width)`` of the sliding
            window_size; the window size must be greater than 0 and fit within
            the shape of ``obs`` and ``fcst``.
        spatial_dims: A pair of dimension names ``(x, y)`` where ``x`` and ``y`` are
            the spatial dimensions to slide the window along to compute the FSS.
            e.g. ``("lat", "lon")``.
        zero_padding: If set to true, applies a 0-valued window border around the
            data field before computing the FSS. If set to false (default), it
            uses the edges (thickness = window size) of the input fields as the border.
            One can think of it as:
            - zero_padding = False => inner border
            - zero_padding = True => outer border with 0 values
        reduce_dims: Optional set of additional dimensions to aggregate over
            (mutually exclusive to ``preserve_dims``).
        preserve_dims: Optional set of dimensions to keep (all other dimensions
            are reduced); By default all dimensions except ``spatial_dims``
            are preserved (mutually exclusive to ``reduce_dims``).
        threshold_operator: The threshold operator used to generate the binary
            event field. E.g. ``np.greater``. Note: this may depend on the backend
            ``compute method`` and not all operators may be supported. Generally,
            ``np.greater``, ``np.less`` and their counterparts. Defaults to "np.greater".
        compute_method: currently only supports :py:obj:`FssComputeMethod.NUMPY`
            see: :py:class:`scores.fast.fss.typing.FssComputeMethod`
        dask: See ``xarray.apply_ufunc`` for options

    Returns:
        An ``xarray.DataArray`` containing the FSS computed over the ``spatial_dims``

        The resultant array will have the score grouped against the remaining
        dimensions, unless ``reduce_dims``/``preserve_dims`` are specified; in which
        case, they will be aggregated over the specified dimensions accordingly.

        For an exact usage please refer to ``FSS.ipynb`` in the tutorials.

    Raises:
        DimensionError: Various errors are thrown if the input dimensions
            do not conform. e.g. if the window size is larger than the input
            arrays, or if the the spatial dimensions in the args are missing in
            the input arrays.

        DimensionWarning: If ``spatial_dims`` are attempting to be preserved e.g. in ``preserve_dims``

    Calculates the Fractions Skill Score (FSS) :sup:`[1]` for a given forecast and observed
    2-D field.

    The FSS is computed by counting the squared sum of forecast and observation
    events in a given window size. This is repeated over all possible window
    positions that can fit in the input arrays. A common method to do this is
    via a sliding window.

    While the various compute backends may have their own implementations; most
    of them use some form of prefix sum algorithm to compute this quickly.

    For 2-D fields this data structure is known as the "Summed Area
    Table" :sup:`[2]`.

    Once the squared sums are computed, the final FSS value can be derived by
    accumulating the squared sums :sup:`[3]`.


    The caller is responsible for making sure the input fields are in the 2-D
    spatial domain. (Although it should work for any `np.array` as long as it's
    2D, and `window_size` is appropriately sized.)

    Args:
        fcst: An array of forecasts
        obs: An array of observations (same spatial shape as ``fcst``)
        event_threshold: A scalar to compare ``fcst`` and ``obs`` fields to generate a
            binary "event" field.

            window; the window dimensions must be greater than 0 and fit within
            the shape of ``obs`` and ``fcst``.
        threshold_operator: The threshold operator used to generate the binary
            event field. E.g. ``np.greater``. Note: this may depend on the backend
            ``compute method`` and not all operators may be supported. Generally,
            ``np.greater``, ``np.less`` and their counterparts. Defaults to "np.greater".

            do not conform. e.g. if the window size is larger than the input
            arrays, or if the the spatial dimensions of the input arrays do
